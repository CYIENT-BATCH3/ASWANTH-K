5balls are numbered with random  1 - digit number each .assign these numbers  using these numbers using user input.
print wheather each ball is assigned odd or even

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a,b,c,d,e,f;//declaring 6 variables
    printf("enter 6 numbers on the balls");
    scanf("%d %d %d %d %d %d",&a,&b,&c,&d,&e,&f);//reading 6 values using scanf
    (a%2==0)?printf("num on th ball is even"):printf("num on th ball is odd");//checking if a is odd or even
    (b%2==0)?printf("\nnum on th ball is even"):printf("\nnum on th ball is odd");//checking if b is odd or even
    (c%2==0)?printf("\n num on th ball  is even"):printf("\nnum on th ball is odd");//checking if c is odd or even
    (d%2==0)?printf("\nnum on th ball  is even"):printf("\nnum on th ball  is odd");//checking if d is odd or even
    (e%2==0)?printf("\nnum on th ball  is even"):printf("\nnum on th ball  is odd");//checking if e is odd or even
    (f%2==0)?printf("\nnum on th ball  is even"):printf("\nnum on th ball  is odd");//checking if f is odd or even
    return 0;
}
